# Reactivities - Still being developed.
Technologies being used - React(Hooks with Typescript), .NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, MobX, MideatR, SignalR

Reactivities is a project similar to facebook's Event feature. 
Registered users will be able to:
        => create personal user profiles, 
        => add photos to their profiles, 
        => edit photos, 
        => view other user profiles,
        => add events or "Activities" and invite other users to their Activities
        => follow other users and see what actitivities they'll be doing.
        => more features to be added later.

This project is a practice and more of an experimental project. However, I will be publishing the project on my domain: softcroissant.com

I am aiming to complete this project around mid October. Feel free to have a look at source code provided in the files.
